# RoadSignNet-SAL: Novel Lightweight Architecture for Road Sign Detection

Novel architecture combining Asymmetric Convolutional Blocks (ACB), Road Sign Attention Module (RSAM), Efficient Feature Pyramid (EFP), and Lightweight Detection Head (LDH) for real-time road sign detection on edge devices.

## Features

- *34% parameter reduction* vs YOLOv8n (3.2M → 2.1M)
- *56% faster* on Raspberry Pi 4 (13 FPS → 20.3 FPS)
- *Novel components*: ACB, RSAM, EFP, LDH
- *Multi-scale detection* with attention at all scales
- *Production-ready* with TensorBoard logging
